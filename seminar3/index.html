                    "Dune" is a very special book. It was written by Frank Herbert 
                    and has fascinated people for a long time. The story takes place
                    in a faraway future where people can travel between stars and where
                    there are a lot of secrets and plots. "Dune" is loved for its 
                    rich world, interesting characters, and important ideas about life.
                    I was first introduced to the film, and being completely surprised
                    by how huge the world was in the film with its own stories and lore,
                    I decided to dive into the book.
