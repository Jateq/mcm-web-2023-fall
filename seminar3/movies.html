  <p class="txt">The film is the third adaptation of Dune following David Lynch's
    1984 film and John Harrison's 2000 television miniseries. After an
    unsuccessful attempt by Paramount Pictures to produce a new adaptation,
    Legendary Entertainment acquired the Dune film and television rights
    in 2016, with Villeneuve signing on as director in February 2017.
    Production contracts were only secured for the first film, relying on
    its success before a sequel would be greenlit. Principal photography
    took place from March to July 2019 at locations including Budapest,
    Jordan, Norway, and Abu Dhabi.</p>

  <p class="txt"> Dune was originally scheduled for a late 2020 release, but it was
    delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film premiered at the 78th
    Venice International Film Festival on September 3, 2021, ahead of its
    international release on September 15; it was then released in United
    States theaters and streaming on HBO Max on October 22. Dune was a box
    office success, earning $402 million on a $165 million budget. It was
    well received by critics and audiences, with praise for Villeneuve's
    direction and screenplay, the visual effects, ambition, costume design,
    Hans Zimmer's musical score, cinematography, and faithfulness to the
    source material. The film was nominated for ten awards at the 94th
    Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning six, and received
    numerous other accolades. It has been widely considered one of the
    best science-fiction films of the 21st century.A direct sequel,
    Dune: Part Two, is set to be released on March 15, 2024.</p>

  <p class="uttxt">The first trailer of "Dune" promises a visual and narrative tour de force
    that leaves audiences breathless. Set against the backdrop of the unforgiving desert
    planet Arrakis, the trailer offers a tantalizing glimpse into the grandeur and gravitas
    of Frank Herbert's legendary universe. With sweeping cinematography, the dunes rise like titans, evoking the epic scale of the source material. The cast, an ensemble of acting luminaries, brings the characters to life with a depth and nuance that honors Herbert's intricate storytelling.

    As the haunting score reverberates, we catch glimpses of Paul Atreides, Lady Jessica, and the formidable Stilgar, each embodying their roles with a palpable intensity. The visual effects transport us to a future where advanced technology coexists with ancient traditions, creating a world both futuristic and timeless.</p>
